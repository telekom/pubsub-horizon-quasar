[![REUSE status](https://api.reuse.software/badge/github.com/telekom/pubsub-horizon-quasar)](https://api.reuse.software/info/github.com/telekom/pubsub-horizon-quasar)
[![Go Test](https://github.com/telekom/pubsub-horizon-quasar/actions/workflows/go-test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/telekom/pubsub-horizon-quasar/actions/workflows/go-test.yml)

## Overview
Quasar is the config-controller powering the Horizon ecosystem. 

> **Note:** Quasar is an essential part of the Horizon ecosystem. Please refer to [documentation of the entire system](https://github.com/telekom/pubsub-horizon) to get the full picture.

## Prerequisites
- A running [Kubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes) cluster
- A running instance of [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) or [Redis (_not fully supported yet_)](https://redis.io)

## Building Quasar
### Go build

Assuming you have already installed [Go](https://go.dev/), simply run the following to build the executable:
```bash
go build
```

> Alternatively, you can also follow the Docker build in the following section if you want to build a Docker image without the need to have Golang installed locally.

### Docker build
This repository provides a multi-stage Dockerfile that will also take care of compiling the software, as well as dockerizing Quasar. Simply run:

```bash
docker build -t horizon-quasar:latest  . 
```

## Configuration
Quasar can be configured using environment variables and/or a configuration file. The following table lists all available configuration options:

**Environment variables aren't officially supported for the `resources` option. It is recommended to configure the `resources` using a configuration/configmap.**

> **Please note:** Redis isn't fully supported (yet) as Hazelcast is the primary cache method of Horizon in its current state.

### Configuring resources
The `resources` configuration option is a list of custom resources that should be synchronized. Each resource has the following fields:
```yaml
kubernetes:
  group: mygroup
  resource: myresource
  version: v1
  namespace: mynamespace
prometheus:
  enabled: true
  labels:
    fixed_value: foobar
    my_dynamic_value: $spec.myfield
mongoIndexes:
  - spec.myfield: 1
  - spec.myfield: 1
    spec.myotherfield: 1
hazelcastIndexes:
  - name: myfield_myotherfield_idx
    fields:
      - data.spec.environment
    type: sorted
```

#### Understanding resources
- `kubernetes`: The Kubernetes resource that should be synchronized.
  - `group`: The group of the resource.
  - `resource`: The name of the resource.
  - `version`: The version of the resource.
  - `namespace`: The namespace of the resource.
- `prometheus`: Prometheus metrics configuration.
     - `enabled`: Whether to expose metrics for this resource.
    - `labels`: Labels that should be exposed as metrics. Labels can be fixed values or values from the resource.
        - Fixed values are defined as strings.
        - Values from the resource are defined as `$<field>`.
- `mongoIndexes`: Indexes that should be created in the MongoDB database.
- `hazelcastIndexes`: Indexes that should be created in the Hazelcast cache.
  - `name`: The name of the index.
  - `fields`: The fields that should be indexed.
  - `type`: The type of the index. Currently, only `sorted` and `hash` are supported.

#### Generating a local configuration
You can generate a local configuration file by running the following command in the directory of the executable:
```bash
./quasar init
```

## Running Quasar
Once you have prepared your configuration, you can run Quasar by executing the following command in the directory of the executable:
```bash
./quasar run
```
